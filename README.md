# TextQuest

A prototype SwiftUI-based text adventure game powered by Apple's on-device Foundation model.

## Overview

TextQuest is a simple text adventure game built as a learning project to explore Swift and SwiftUI development. The app leverages Apple's built-in Foundation model for natural language processing, ensuring all interactions remain completely local with no external API calls or data sharing.

## Features

- Interactive text-based adventure gameplay
- On-device LLM integration using Apple's Foundation model
- SwiftUI interface with multiple chat/game sessions
- Completely offline - no network requests required

## Technical Details

- Built with SwiftUI and Swift
- Uses Apple's MLX Swift framework for local LLM integration
- Designed for iOS/macOS platforms
- No external dependencies or API keys required

## Note

This is a prototype/learning project exploring Swift development and on-device AI capabilities. The game mechanics and UI are intentionally simple to focus on the core technical implementation.
